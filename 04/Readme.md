Work: Optional CGOL extension:
GOAL:

Apply an automated generational propagation mechanism to your CGOL apparatus.

YOUR CODING MISSION:

Make your own copy of Animate.java from the daily code directory.
As a team, read for understanding, run, repeat as necessary until understanding achieved.
Discuss, as a team, how you will approach grafting the animation code onto your generation transition code. Pick the approach that makes the most sense to all teammates, and implement it.
PROTIPS:
Design first. Sketch out your plan on paper ("keys to success"), transcribe into comments in your code file.
Get something, however, minimal, to compile and run ASAP. Incrementally grow it until it aligns with your goal.
Never stray far from runnable code.
Grow cohort KB ("knowledge base") on slack:
Have a Q? Ask.
Confident in your skills/knowledge? See how well you can explain it.
DELIVERABLE:
Save in your work repo: 4/Cgol.java
Include heading at top of file, as comment. List all collaborators and consultants.
